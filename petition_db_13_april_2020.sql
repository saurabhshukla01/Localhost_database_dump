That’s the reason we, along with our natural environment, everything is in huge danger. People perform and participate several activities in saving the environment and it’s all associated natural resources but, when it comes to the implementation of some initiatives that lead to saving the environment, people either steps back or do not make an initiate. </p><br />\r\n<strong>If this would be going to remain the still then, how would the things go to work? </strong><br />\r\n<p>So, such initiatives are good to make but collectively, we need to save our environment because the time has already begun when we are supposed to pay for water and fresh oxygen. </p><br />\r\n<p>How amazing is this that the basic two natural and important resources have become so polluted by human blunders that now we have to pay for fresh mineral water and purified oxygen to inhale. So, being the residents of the earth, irrespective of any colour, caste, creed, belief or religion collectively, we are required to take an action. Henceforth, all of us is required to boost and powered up the methodologies towards environment management with brainstorming strategies so that no penny should be paid for any natural resources.

People feel it on the bottom line when it comes to the power drops inclusive the surcharges of airline fuel and generators. Owing to this, it has drastically resulted in the planet’s resource exploration, emissions and has also limited its development. Thus, implementing green power solutions have immensely become an essential and efficient pathway for energy and resource conservation.</p> <br />\r\n<p>Additionally, initiating such responsibilities must include the below-mentioned pointers: <br/><br />\r\n1.<b>Reduction:</b> Reduction in terms of an environment fundamentally focusses on the appropriate use of energy and resources, carbon emissions and all associated cost. <br/><br />\r\n2.<b>Efficiency:</b> As the term itself suggests efficiency, it majorly means preventing the energy which is unnecessarily getting waste. Prevention ad saving of energy would automatically lead to cost-cutting and cost-saving. <br/> <br />\r\n3.<b>Innovation:</b> To come up with new ideologies that strive its best in proving the energy-saving solutions. <br/><br />\r\n4.<b> Engagement:</b> To participate more and more in the environment saving practices driving more of the saving of resources overconsumption. <br/><br />\r\n5.<b>Accountability:</b> A blend of appropriate usage of natural & environmental resources. </p><br />\r\n<p>Alongside this, when it comes to the reduction in the energy consumption, there are again some measures that are required to be taken into the consideration and could drive the best out of the box results such as: <br/><br />\r\n1.<b>Green energy destinations:</b> It just needs to be explored. Every destination comprises of some unique energy profile wherein, some regions still require more and more greenery and energy sourcing. <br/><br />\r\n2.<b>Green energy venues:</b> Explore the destinations that are not much blessed with the low-emissions components. Here is the best step to make a move. Try to explore the venue where more and more sources of renewable energy could be adopted both by the place and the people. <br/><br />\r\n3.<b>Responsible transportation:</b> Both practically and ideally, green-minded environmental practices could easily avoid additional use of energy majorly when it comes to transportation and commuting by designing walkable, cycle-able and transit-accessible vehicles. On the other hand, if such components don’t seem possible to have or avail at the respective moment then, try to find out the hybrid or electric vehicles inclusive of biodiesel as well. <br/><br />\r\n4.<b>Portable generation:</b> To adopt portable generation mostly prove to reduce the energy load over your power generator. Such form of initiative pertaining to generators result in the least polluting and makes the least noise. <br/><br />\r\nHenceforth, the safety of the environment is in our hands only, the more we conserve it, the more we would be able to reserve the resources for the upcoming time.

According to the<br />\r\ngovernment’s data, Ujjwala Scheme targeted 5 Cr. Subsidised LPG connections<br />\r\nwherein, a major ratio of BPL families has been a dud on the grounds of this<br />\r\nscheme. It has observed that BPL families have claimed that they are unable to<br />\r\nafford LPG refills. <br />\r\nScheme Launched: for People Welfare or Votes Bagging? <br />\r\nHowever, the Ujjwala Scheme was launched for bagging of votes during elections<br />\r\nwith a promise that each rural woman of below poverty line household would be<br />\r\nfacilitated with the same but unfortunately, because of the high cost of LPG refills<br />\r\nthey saw a major dud. The strategy of acquiring the bulk votes was quite interesting<br />\r\nas it focussed on BPL household visits while sitting on the muddy floor and eating<br />\r\nthe meal cooked on the earthen stove or Chulhas. <br />\r\nHowever, to get the LPG cylinder under this scheme the BPL family woman required<br />\r\nto fill a form provided by the respective gas agency while paying the subsidized price<br />\r\nof ? 1750 otherwise without such scheme it would be costing ? 2950. <br />\r\nA Curse or A Cause<br />\r\nPeople of such families did enjoy the scheme until the time the cylinder doesn’t<br />\r\nrequire the refill. With the passing away of the gas, they again came back to the<br />\r\nChulhas using kerosene oil and other kinds of solid fuels. The emitted smoke from<br />\r\nsuch substances led to hazardous health issues. Moreover, as per the World Health<br />\r\nOrganisation, worldwide, 3.8 million people die because of the smoke exposure from<br />\r\nthe dirty stoves. Also, the stats obtained from WHO quoted that in India, 4,88,200<br />\r\ndeaths occur every year just because of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease<br />\r\n(COPD), ischaemic heart disease, due to pneumonia, lung cancer, and stroke. Also,<br />\r\n8 complete years are lost amid 1,000 people majorly because of the indoor air<br />\r\npollution wherein, the most affected people are the children and the woman. <br />\r\nSaving Wealth or Losing Health <br />\r\nBoth the Indian societies as well as the government need to understand that cooking<br />\r\non Chulhas renders a huge number of fumes and smog which adversely affect the<br />\r\nenvironment then, how a human being can remain unaffected from the same? If,<br />\r\nUjjwala Scheme has been properly implemented focusing on the low cost of the gas<br />\r\nrefill then, it could have successfully helped the sufferers which they have been<br />\r\nfacing because of the constant use of Chulhas. <br />\r\nThe use of Chulhas adversely affects human health that it can cause a loss of vision,<br />\r\nlungs problem, inhaling or other breathing problems and a lot more than one can<br />\r\never imagine. For your safeguard, you need to take any action while not fully relying<br />\r\non government schemes. However, the government must support people with the<br />\r\nproper implementation of such schemes. It must organize the schemes that it may<br />\r\nnot affect the people for a shorter time span, in fact, help them in solving all their<br />\r\ndaily hurdles. <br />\r\nOne Initiative is Essential<br />\r\nThe people of such areas are out of the reach of a flourished money, so they feel<br />\r\nthemselves helpless.

Also, as per the government concerns, it<br />\r\nshould have set up the reasonable prices of gas refilling that people from Chulhas<br />\r\nmay move towards the LPG. This would surely bring a positive effect on society and<br />\r\nthe economy. <br />\r\nAgain, the concluded reason states that the unaffordability of LPG cylinders is the<br />\r\ncore concern of using Chulhas with the help of cow dung and coal that are easily<br />\r\naccessible. Else, in the fastest running era of the technology where Gas Stove is<br />\r\nbeing also replaced by the Electronic Induction, who wants to cook food on the<br />\r\nburning wood emitting fumes.

Moreover, the prices are expected to soar more by the end of February 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Triggering of Unseasonable Rainfall led Crop Damage  </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The prices of onion have risen drastically in all over the country. The reason behind the rising cost is unseasonal rain as well as the shortage of onion crop. Also, the worst part is that the rising cost has not even benefited a single farmer instead they have complained that none of the onion crops has been fetched because of its poor quality. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Increasing Consumption led to Decreasing Requirements </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In accordance with some sophisticated sources, in India, the monthly consumption of onions was 15 lakh metric tons which shows a requirement of 50 thousand metric tons. But, with the high cost, the daily supply has become 10-12%, as of now. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Appeal to Government – a Solution for a Common Man</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people and other associated welfare bodies have asked the government to create onion’s buffer stock, distribution of the staple at a reasonable cost, a crackdown on the hoarding of onion’s traders, etc just to relief a middle class and a common man. Onion as a staple of each kitchen in every household has affected not only the general public but a huge mass of farmers as well. Indian farmers have emotionally expressed a painful concern because most of them are distributing the old stock of onion because of the damaging of new onions. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just because the wholesale market has seen a huge spike in the cost, it has simultaneously affected the resulting market as well. Wherein, this sharper jump is restricting the public to make a hole in their pockets. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The nationwide surge in the spike of onion price has affected most of the Indian states and cities such as Pune, Maharashtra, Chennai, Mumbai, Odisha, West Bengal, Kolkata, Delhi and a lot more. Therein, it has affected the market chain by affecting both the sellers and consumers in buying an onion. Nevertheless, daily consumers are unfortunately are forced to reduce their purchases and are cooking their delicious food as – onion free. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Battlefield between State & Central Government </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, the worst condition expressed by the farmers is the rotten onion which can neither be used nor purchased and can only get wasted by throwing and dumping it in the dustbins. Most of the citizens have appealed to the Central Government to take impactful immediate actions but, the tussle amid the state and the central government is affecting the common man, alas!!! </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Onion’s Robbery at Dusk’s Early Hours </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, the robbery of goods that can benefit you in any ground has been seen and observed in several different cases. But, have you ever heard of Onion’s robbery. Could you ever imagine that onions can also be getting stolen? Sounds funny; but, it’s true, 250kg onions worth ?2500 have been stolen from Gujarat vegetable shop during the early hours of dawn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Government in Jitters & Public in Tears </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such a looming onion crisis has put the government in jitters as well as the general public in tears. Therein, huge strata focussing on several households, cafes, and restaurants have been affected adversely. In short, this food inflation has made the entire nation cry where people are left with no choice just to maintain a cost-cutting for onion. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Indian Government must enlighten the issue and should immediately take the concern into consideration. This is because the continuous spike in the price is neither good for the country and nor for the Indian traders and farmers who are stagnantly witnessing a great fall in the onion demand.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Onion, with which every food tastes tasteless, is now getting reduced from the daily menus, dishes, and salads. However, to avoid the further disruption of the onion trade in the country, the government has placed orders for 6,090 tonnes of onions from Egypt to prevent India from Onion’s Crisis. This initiative would somewhere support the daily income of Indian farmers. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hope so, fresh and quality harvest may sooner hit the Indian market vanishing food inflation at its best.</p>\r\n', 0, 0, 0, 2000, 2, '2019-12-06 05:32:46', '2020-04-02 04:21:01'),

Most of the people play fraudulent activities with the name of branded organization and promise to unemployed ones providing a job with complete security. When a jobseeker gets influenced by the fraudsters, they ask for money. If a person gives the quoted amount then, these fraudsters run away leaving behind a no clue of their identification. </p>\r\n<p>    \r\nNo one knows where a nation will go if this would be continuing the way it is. Also, in the era of technology as well as digitalization, Information Technology (IT) domain is phasing the rough period of streamlining cost majorly concentrating on the employees of mid to senior level.

The number has been improvised because of the actions taken by the people such as FIRs against child sex abuse, awareness programs and raids at suspected ultrasound centres. </p><br />\r\n<p>Alongside the initiative taken by the local citizens, the state health department also acted as the watchdogs over the centres conducting prenatal sex determination tests. For more of the awareness, one strongly needs to educate every girl in his family with a core objective focusing on gender determination which is illegal and on sexual biases as well.

But, this also needs to be understood by the society that marriage is not only about physical love, sex or romance. If in any married relationship, without considering the tenure of the wedding, if your spouse especially your wife is not ready or prepared for physical love and you are forcing her to have that attention then, unfortunately, you are raping her, martially. </p><br />\r\n<strong>What Marital Rape states?</strong> <br />\r\n<p>To force a woman for physical love and attention without her permission in a marital relationship is known as Marital Rape. </p><br />\r\n<p>Talking about the Marital Rape, Narendra Modi’s government destabilizes the institution of marriage which could also act as a weapon to harass husbands. The government needs to understand and discover a stronger correlation amid saving the marriage institution as well as criminalizing marital rape. It’s a matter of concern that how difficult it could be getting a raped by a husband. From a societal point of view, this is not a big deal and is an obvious point but, for a female, this is nothing less than a brutal rape when she is not prepared and is not willing for physical love. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Just because you’re married so, forceful sex is okay</strong><br />\r\n<p>In India, there seem a lot of females who are a victim of the marital rape and continuously appeal for the justice but there is no hearing in the eyes of law, in the grounds of court and, in fact, in front of families. This is so because everyone seems that a couple is married so sex is official and is okay but, the concern gets over neglected that whether a person is willing or not without noticing that it’s a married couple. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Woman – a subject for sex, machine producing babies and idol of romance</strong><br />\r\n<p>Additionally, as per the societal point of view, in marital sex, a reasonable person is always a male wherein, a woman always ends up as a device of baby-making as well as an idol of romance. A typical marital rapist is the one who still believes that a woman can be ruled and dominated as per his will and choice. Also, he feels that in sexual matters if he wants sex then, she should be glad and if she isn’t then, a man has a complete right to force her. Overall this shows that he is an object and a lady is a sexual subject to play or mold with. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Feminism majorly exists in male dominating society</strong> <br />\r\n<p>Still today, the society is somewhere male-dominant where being feminist is not wrong. Thus, in such a male dominant society woman’s struggle is not only limited but reasonable as well. All man seriously needs to understand that a woman is not a sexual property.

Therefore, to represent and introduce India as free from plastic, PM Modi had been addressed in the New York’s 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly. </p><br />\r\n<p>The Campaign has been greatly welcomed and must be welcomed by the Indian citizens as it’s we only who have to make India a plastic banned country.

Out of the 20,000 tons approx. 13-14000 tons get collected and rest either remains scattered on the roads or remained alive in the sea, river or ponds. Herein, a problem comes into consideration that after implementation of such a huge campaign in all over India, still a huge amount of the plastic wastes are found either scattered or dumped at certain places. Such form of an inadequate collection including ‘n’ numbers of the recycling systems, India needs the right direction to be a healthy and wealthy nation or to be called a plastic-free nation in real-sense.</p> <br />\r\n<strong>Plastic Revolution: A Serious Revolution </strong><br />\r\n<p>A serious revolution is required amid the people living in the nation while getting influenced by Plastic Revolution for a plastic-free nation. Therein, it had been strongly appealed by the constructors, builders and varied shopkeepers to recycle plastic wherever possible and start providing goods in paper or cloth bags instead of the plastic ones.</p> <br />\r\n<p>Also, the nation is requested to make a shout out in saying goodbye to the plastic urging citizens to curb the use of the same. Thus, saying goodbye isn’t sufficient it is also required to ban all kinds of the small and tiny plastics focusing on plastic carry bags, artificial banners, thermocol disposable cutlery, flags and flowers, plastic folders and water bottles, food packaging, bottles, straws, containers, cups, etc.</p><br />\r\n ', 0, 0, 0, 4500, 2, '2020-01-08 05:30:48', '2020-04-02 04:21:01'),

In fact, it is natural that an organization is motivated only with its motivated employees. In the hustle bustle of the competitive era where everyone is a player to win the organizational race, managers of the firm must focus both on the financial rewards and employees motivation as well. </p><br />\r\n<p>However, sometimes employee’s motivation using rewards becomes intimidating for the managers. This should not happen because when your work culture is armed with the correct and appropriate information and tactics then why would managers feel daunt in enhancing the motivation of his employees using rewards in no time. The managers who always develop and revamp the employee rewards program must concentrate on some of the most mandatory aspects. </p><br />\r\n<strong>This article would tell you in brief… </strong><br />\r\n<p>Employees Involvement in the implementation of a rewards program would work better because this would encourage them interacting amid all the staff no matter senior or junior. Doing so would also ensure that the upper management including all the employees is on board with the organization’s reward system.</p> <br />\r\n<p>On the contrary, it should be noticeable that employee’s involvement in such programs is a worthy effort. The managers must always value the inputs provided by them irrespective of their designation, experience and age and then, select rewards accordingly. Owing to this, the employees who see worthy efforts in rewards will always feel motivated and would often act proactively.</p> <br />\r\n<p>It’s also important on the part of managers to assure that how employees can also comprehend to earn rewards. Involving them in the programs and valuing their inputs must not be restricted. However, managers should clearly explain to them how they can earn rewards. This is because, when your employees would be having a transparent understanding of expectations then, they will be capable enough of achieving the same. <br/><br />\r\nOn the contrary, employees must also establish transparent and reasonable performance standards to achieve rewards. This would lead them to engage the necessary efforts as expected or sometimes beyond expectations. Thus, managers must check in with the employees assuring that the rewards are near to their reach. Additionally, assisting the employees with a relevant dashboard via which they could observe their daily, weekly or monthly performance in real-time as per their assigned task. This is because; this would also allow them to have proper access to their tasks and performances in order to have realistic expectations for the expected rewards. </p><br />\r\n<p> Also, it\'s genuine on the manager’s part which employees should also understand that rewards are always based on the determination of the objective performance data. This is because, when the rewards get served based on the same then, more likely, employees feel no biases in the process and generate a right understanding of what is expected from them. Unbiased or fair judgment always fills employees with great motivation, enthusiasm, passion, and zeal towards the work. </p><br />\r\n<p>Assuring that employees are served with the unbiased reward system abreast with the fair distribution would encourage them to obtain more rewards simultaneously would generate more productivity. Also, it must be taken into consideration that engaging in cutting corners or favoritism will render a detrimental impact on the performance of the employees. Whereas, linking rewards to the performance would influence employees leaving a positive impact. Owing to such practices, the employees would be able to see the complete transparency in the work culture, organizational environment and would also apprehend the connection amid their rewards and performance. Thus, all of them will be automatically get motivated to optimally perform in the near future. </p><br />\r\n<p>In accordance with the met expected milestones, employees must be rewarded ensuring that they have fairly received the recognition for their progress including the consistency in their behavior as per the company’s expectations. In such a case, it’s better to discover the team based incentives because this could be effective enough to make employees passionate and enthusiast towards the work simultaneously would lead in increasing both the performance and productivity. However, if an organization doesn’t work on team-based rewards then, it must include it in its rewards program where devoted resources to team-based rewards must be substantial. Such a practice would surely go to leave a significant impact on employee’s cohesiveness as well as cooperation.<br/> <br />\r\nOn the contrary, there could also be a fatal flaw of not rewarding the top performers thusly, a good performer should never be taken for granted in order to maintain and flourish the top talent not only in the team but also in the organization. So, timely acknowledgment of rewards on excellent performance is a must. </p><br />\r\n<p>However, there is also some certain factor associated with maintenance of top talents which becomes obvious and natural after some point in time. This gets showcased when an employee makes it his behavioral habit. Hence, the managers should not offer the non-monetary rewards and recognition despite financial rewards which must be distributed depending on the variable ratio. </p><br />\r\n<p>It all depends on how well employees perform and at what extent does he dedicate himself. This could believe that long-term reward programs leave a positive effect on the overall performance leading to generate the long-lasting results.

As per the judgement, a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court without opposition rule stated that having a sexual relationship with a female without her husband’s knowledge was a criminal offence.

As per the document released by the conference which is also called Teheran Proclamation, it clearly states that <b>“Parents have a basic human right to determine freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children.”</b></p><br />\r\n<p>On the other hand, it is also important to note that, India being the vast population country, one can’t overlook the implications of population explosion. Therein, over the last couple of years, the population growth is found on the urge to exceed more and more, by and far. Additionally, it is also notable that this urge of the population has reached to the surge due to the contributions of socio-economic culture and conditions, historical facts, policy changes and a lot more. </p><br />\r\n<p>Thus, people of the country are requested to deliver a limited as well as a planned baby which would help in the contribution of the quality population whilst population growth and control. </p><br />\r\n<p> Therefore, for a purpose of upholding a right quality family planning, people should concentrate on the below-mentioned parameters that are required to be implemented, monitored and regulated for the healthy changes in the concerning family planning.</p><br />\r\n<strong>No Gender Biasness</strong><br />\r\n<p> Family Planning including all the concerns associated with it must not be restricted to any sex, caste, creed, race, gender, religions, political views, language, nationality, economic status, native place, marital status, disability status etc. Doing so could result in ‘n’ numbers of mental trauma inside the person expecting to have a newborn. </p><br />\r\n<strong> Awareness</strong><br />\r\n<p> Coming to the precautions and contraceptive pills, proper information, awareness and knowledge must be circulated to everyone without hesitations. Sex education is necessary especially when it comes to serious concerns like Family Planning. Thus, sex education should be available to everyone at the right age and time based on the fractioning needs, differentiating factors and some little barriers associated with the same. Hence, it becomes exceptionally essential to understand the information’s quality depending on the background, education and health infrastructure. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Hassle-Free Implementation of Ideologies for Family Planning </strong><br />\r\n<p>When it comes to the implementation and formulation of the entire guidelines in the context of the <b>family planning</b>, there must not be a lack of access towards the hassle-free implementation. Here, access means the level and depth of rigor pertaining to accessibility and affordability. Herein, both the physical accessibility as well as affordability is the two major components that must be taken into consideration while thinking of expanding your generation or family. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Healthy Acceptance of Contraceptives </strong><br />\r\n<p>While intimacy and <strong>another discussion of family planning</strong>, it is highly suggestible to properly make use of contraceptive products that too in a dignified way while respecting the modern ways of medical policies and ethics as well. </p><br />\r\n<strong>No hide and seek in communication</strong><br />\r\n<p> While having a discussion about other members of the family pertaining to the concerns and issues of family planning, proper communication with respect to everyone’s acceptance and ideologies must be respected. This is so because; a small idea or view of any family member could guide a spouse towards the right ways. Thus, clear communication is necessary without pressurizing and provoking anyone. Moreover, coming to the contraceptive commodities, it must be purchased and rendered by sophisticated sanitary personnel. </p><br />\r\n<strong> Informed & Mutual Decisions </strong><br />\r\n<p> A family doesn’t restrict to the spouse and parents instead while panning a baby, most of the relations start getting connected with each other and with a baby as well before his or her birth in the world. So, while thinking of the <b>family planning</b>, each member of the family must be informed well enough reflecting free misrepresentation of the views and personal relationship. Herein, contraceptive counseling essentially becomes comprehensive equipping members to apprehend their decisions.</p><br />\r\n<strong> Not Disclosing the Maternity Matters </strong><br />\r\n<p>Best and healthy treatment is the most crucial factor to attain during family planning and other further processes of the same. Therefore, maintaining complete confidentiality, privacy and security in the treatment and other decisions must be locked amid the doctors, health workers, co-staff and other members as well. This is so because, there are a lot of people who visit the maternity centers every day, disclosing the patient’s history would affect all in making effective decisions for planning a baby. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Women Involvement with no Forceful Decisions </strong><br />\r\n<p>While planning a family to conceive and deliver a baby, at last, it’s the woman only who has to deliver a baby. Thus, this must be ensured that the woman who becomes the recipient for family planning should be well prepared when it comes to the development spheres influencing her decision and other health measures. Additionally, when it comes to the policies concerning reproductive and sexual health, family planning must be called from an educational and healthy point of views involving gynecologists, doctors, and other co-working staff members.<br/><br />\r\nImperative accountability must be reflected in the massive family members majorly by doctors, sex educators, and lifestyle specialists, health personnel majorly including family doctors, physicians and gynecologists etc. in order to maintain a high standard of accountability.

This is actually so because the word epidemic itself comprises of a huge meaning in its existence. An epidemic could be anything which begins with a small symptom and later turns into a big disease and hence is termed <b>as Epidemic</b>.</p>\r\n<p>These days, the same is happening in the case of Coronavirus. However, people are getting various information and facts regarding the virus and hence, is listed as the infodemic.<br/>\r\nAs the Coronovirus is rapidly increasing in the major countries of the world wherein, China has been hugely tapped by it. The virus has been s threatening and has proven to be life taking amid the people that everyone fears with its name. The major issue is the recognition of the same i.e. how to analyse and diagnose that whether a person is suffering from some illness is either Coronavirus or something else. So, the symptoms and diagnosis of the virus are mentioned below: <br/>\r\n· Fever <br/>\r\n· Cough <br/><br />\r\n· Shortness of breath  <br/>\r\n· Runny Nose <br/>\r\n· Headache  <br/>\r\n· Sore Throat <br/>\r\nThough such symptoms are found to be very common and can be easily cured but in case of such virus, these symptoms should not be overlooked as it has caused a large number of deaths these days in just the couple of days. Thus, for confirmed, 2019-nCoV infections have reported a severe illness leading death. </p>\r\n<p>It is also believed that the symptoms of 2019-nCoV may appear either in 2 days or as long as in 14 days. Also, it is entirely based on the incubation period of the MERS virus. Apart from such noticeable symptoms, it also includes some other symptoms as well such as 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1. All such symptoms generally caused some upper-respiratory tract illnesses majorly in the context of common cold, pneumonia or bronchitis. However, such illness is basically found in the people suffering from cardiopulmonary disease and the people with the weaker immune system. </p>\r\n<p> In addition to this, one should also enlighten that the other two associated symptoms of Coronavirus i.e. MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV have also become frequently familiar with the people resulting in life-ending happenings. With the sufferings of such virus, approx. 3-4 people out of 10 have been sentenced to death on almost frequent hourly intervals. </p>\r\n<strong>What precautions one should take for avoidance and prevention of Coronavirus? </strong>\r\n•    Frequent hand washing with alcohol-based hand wash or liquid soap as it would help in killing the germs and virus. <br/>\r\n•    Maintain respiratory hygiene. This would be only performed while covering both face and mouth with tissue paper or handkerchief mainly while coughing and sneezing. Doing so would help in preventing the germs and virus and could contaminate the objects or people you come into contact with. <br/>\r\n•    Stop touching your mouth, face, nose and eyes because touching such surfaces could result in virus contamination. Touching such parts may result in virus transferring immensely and exceptionally. <br/>\r\n•    Avoid consuming animal’s products (all forms of non-veg) and stop being into contact with the animals like camel, rats, cats, rodents, birds, bats and dogs as well. <br/>\r\n<p>Therefore, the diagnosis of such symptoms has been essentially required to save people from the massively growing epidemic all around the clock. Your doctors and other health care providers should examine you by performing some of the laboratory tests on respiratory specimens all the major blood test (called serum) in order to detect the presence of Coronavirus if any. If you found the test with positive results, then, you must immediately contact your doctor informing him about your recent travelling, non-veg intake and animal’s contact. A large number of MERS-CoV infections has been detected from Arabian Peninsula’s country and so, it becomes highly essential to note and report about your travel diaries and history or animal’s contact.

However, as per the political scenarios, there have been 3 concerned contests amid Congress, Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).

Thus, on the polling date i.e. on Feb 8, voters can exercise their franchise from morning 8 am onwards. However, it is also suggested, and one should make a note of it that, you should not vote to the candidate getting influenced by your near and dear ones. This is so because, most of the times, people vote to those parties by getting influenced from their friends, family members, relatives or other acquaintances. On the other hand, the people who influence others are also requested not to brainwash or influence others in such a way that their vote seems useless or gets wasted. Doing so results in malpractices for both the people; the one who gets influenced and the one who influences others. </p><br />\r\n<p>Observing all such observations, the Election Commission of India has moved towards the EVMs (Electronic Voting Machine). EVMs have replaced the concept of Ballot Papers because people were encouraging others for forceful voting and were encouraging the candidates towards the victory. Thus, such practices are of no use, if each one would influence others for forceful voting. Basically, such kind of practice had also become a monotony as well wherein, family traditions could be listed on top. This is so because, most of the Family’s HOD say that, we have always been a supporter of this particular party from our generations so, we will be casting our vote to the same without knowing that what are their right and wrongdoings.<br />\r\nSo, open up your mind and be so rational to caste a right vote to the right candidate or a ruling party.  </p><br />\r\n ', 0, 0, 0, 6000, 1, '2020-02-10 09:50:11', '2020-04-02 04:21:01'),

Moreover, the blockade affected huge traffic in a day abreast with delays of hours in the shortest journeys. </p>\r\n<p>Owing to this, around 5 petitions have been filed, as of now raising the issue of highways and roads blockade wherein, the Delhi High Court refused the hearings of initial 2 pleas and quoted towards the police matter. Simultaneously, on the other hand, the Delhi Police stated that they would use persuasion over force to take blockade at an end. When, this also failed to bring the result, again a third petition was filed on 18th January 2020 raising the student’s difficulty specifically during the exam’s time. Therein, the High Court again appeal the police to investigate the matter. Unfortunately, the situation went out of control and the matter reached to the Supreme Court with filed pleas wherein, it has been expected that after the occasion of national importance (elections), the pleas would be enlightened. </p>\r\n<strong>Why disturbance in Nation? </strong>\r\n<p>Well, alongside all such concerns, issues, violence and riots, one must also thoroughly know the root cause of all such disrupting happenings inside the nation. The CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) was passed by the Indian Parliament on 12th December 2019 that amends the Citizenship Act of 1995. Under the religious persecution’s assumptions, it granted a swifter way to Indian citizenship mainly to those people who belong to minorities like Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jains, Parsi, Christians and people mainly from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan. This act also meant for those people who entered India before 31st December 2014. Whereas, neither the act mentioned Muslims, nor did they offer the associated benefits to Muslim immigrants. Additionally, the worst part of the protest is that it has been immensely affecting the country’s economic crisis witnessing an increasing household debt as well as decreasing growth rate in income and other earning sources. </p>\r\n<strong>What’s Indifferent? </strong>\r\n<p>The protest of Shaheen Bagh began with a minimum of 10-15 women since 14th December 2019. Afterwards, this 2-digit number got extended to the strength of thousands and lakhs. Many people joined the protests including the students and children which then became 24*7 protest. Also, amid the huge crowd, most of the women were Muslim as they found of wearing a burqa. The unacceptable truth is that females with the new born babies or the lactating ones are also a part of this unworthy constant protest. </p>\r\n<strong>Hunger Strike</strong>\r\n<p>Also, to lead this protest further in most exceptional ways, many of the people amid the crowd have started volunteering it in different ways like Hunger Strike and Children Protest. Owing to this, few of the protestors were on hunger strike for days and later on got hospitalised. What was the use of doing this? Instead, one’s own health got affected and nothing happened, nothing got changed. The reason for the hunger strike was the police brutality on the students, violence on females in Jamia washroom’s and library and all the associated issues with the case. With the hunger strike, people also demanded the rollback of NRC and CAA. Unfortunately, no government office or associated governmental bodies took this hunger strike into consideration and even didn’t visit the protestors of the same. </p>\r\n<strong>Misinformation Misleading Children…Child Protest</strong>\r\n<p>Also, since day 1 of the strike, many of the children started joining their parents to participate in the strike. In the morning they attend their school afterwards they become the strike’s participant. Now, it seems like Shaheen Bagh has become an artistic space for most of the children because they express their thoughts through poetry, storytelling, mimicry, puppetry and painting graffiti. In fact, many children participate in the sit-in protest holding candles in their hands.

This is so because, in today’s virtual world, IT is the only major component that applies to social media simultaneously affecting as well as effecting the life of people. </p><br />\r\n<p>As we are talking about the interaction that has been transformed into the virtual domain, there exist different kinds of interactivity that people often take into consideration.

Today, there have been most of the media platforms available on the Internet that are inherently active wherein, it pushes the people to react in a way like a behaviourist computer-based learning encourages people to react. It is not surprising that technologies that control a learner’s responses are often associated with more behaviourist approaches to learning.</p><br />\r\n<strong>Designed Interactivity </strong><br />\r\n<p>Several times it happens that some media gets utterly designed that automatically generates interest in the learners inclusive of engaging interactions.

Some media doesn’t always comprise of the in-built interaction wherein, its end users could still interact either with some physical responses or cognitively. For instance, the concept could be better understood considering an incident of an art gallery. Several times, people inside the art gallery respond either emotionally or cognitively to some of the particular paintings while simultaneously others may just have a glance of it or simply passes by. As per the student’s concerns, they may choose to make sketches or drawings from the painting, etc.<br/> <br />\r\nNevertheless, media that is responsible both in encouraging and provoking people have also cost some associated advantages with it.

This is so because both the instructors, as well as the learners, often have the options and preferences of choosing and using the medium pertaining that how it affects the learner’s interaction and feedback happening inside the single medium. Therefore, the design’s quality of having interactive experiences is highly important over the medium of interaction that enables activity.<br/> <br />\r\nHowever, it should also be noted that the technology’s choice can often reduce the activity’s level including the interaction’s quality. Alongside this, when it comes to the real scenarios, people are more likely to make use of an amalgamation of media assuring a quality-oriented and interactivity associated activities. Simultaneously, on the other hand, making use of varied media sources or channel are often likely to increase both the workload and the cost as well amid the learners and instructors. </p><br />\r\n ', 0, 0, 0, 10000, 2, '2020-02-14 15:00:52', '2020-04-02 04:21:01'),

Do you know India contributes an additional 1,000,000 kids to its already high population every 20 days? With a growth rate of 20% per decade Indian population has deep and long-lasting repercussions. Indian has a population of 1.3 people currently, making it the second most populated country in the world. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><strong>Problems Due to Rising Population: </strong></span><br />\r\nThe food deficit, pollution and deteriorating sanitation and infrastructure to top the list. No matter how much the economic growth rate rises, the living standards do not raise at the same rate. In India, only <strong><em>\"only 6% of India\'s poor have access to tap water versus 33% of the non-poor.\"</em>  </strong>Sanitation till date remains a huge ongoing issue that the government is unable to address. Moreover, India has some of the most polluted cities in the world. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Two-Child Policy in India:</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nBefore January 2020 India did not have a National Child policy. Thus family Planning Policies like Two-Child Policy comes as the need of the hour by the Indian Government. National Volunteer Organization (RSS) leader Mohan Bhagwat declared in January 2020 his organization\'s primary goal as a Two-Child Policy. The proposal is being criticized as an attempt to curtail the Indian Muslim Population. <br />\r\nIndia’s National Population Policy aims to stabilize India’s population by 2045. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong><em>\"A two-child policy is a government-imposed limit of two children allowe</em></strong><strong><em>d per </em></strong></span><strong><em><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">family, with the perks of government subsidies given only to the first two children.\"</span></em></strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnder the two-child policy - persons with more than two children would not be eligible to serve in government jobs. The act also called the Population Control Act, 2016 is applicable to all of India. As per the act, no person should procreate more than two living children after a period of one year from the commencement of the Act. <br />\r\nMany Indian states have adopted the two-child policy. It was Assam where the policy was most recently implemented in 2017. By 2017, 12 states had called for the two-child limitation for being eligible for a government job. The states are Odisha, Bihar, Chattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana. The policy has repealed by some of the states like Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Chattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. <br />\r\nAs per a report of the East Asia Forum India\'s population is projected to be 1.69 billion by 2050. It will make India\'s population higher than that of China.  Looking at the population prediction of India by 2050 the country may undergo a crisis situation. The demand for food and water will double up by 2050. India may be able to feed the growing population, however, may not be ecologically sustainable. Thus, the two-child policy is the most promising solution to the family planning initiative by the Indian Government. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n ', 0, 0, 0, 20000, 2, '2020-03-13 16:35:25', '2020-04-02 04:21:01'),

It is dangerous for a country as densely populated as India.

Authorities did not even know\r\nabout them since they were asymptomatic. These people unknowingly exposed the other larger\r\npopulation to help to spread the virus.\r\n\r\nTwo days ago in India, a 20-year-old man travelled by train from Delhi to Chennai. The\r\nauthorities did not find his travel history of any contact with anyone who travelled abroad - but\r\nhe tested positive for Coronavirus. This case sends alarm bells ringing. It was India first case of\r\nCoronavirus due to community transmission.\r\n\r\nIn countries like Italy, Dubai, South Korea, the fatalities caused due to Covid-19 surged only\r\nafter the community transmissions began. It is impossible for their governments to stop the\r\nspread of the virus infection now.\r\nStepping out is as bad as a CRIME:  \r\nElderly people above 65 Years of age are at High Risk of catching the Coronavirus. Indian\r\ncurrently has above 80 million people of age 65 and above.\r\n  33% of the Indian population lives in home\'s less than the size of a prison cell.

So, being the residents of the earth, irrespective of any colour, caste, creed, belief or religion collectively, we are required to take an action. Henceforth, all of us is required to boost and powered up the methodologies towards environment management with brainstorming strategies so that no penny should be paid for any natural resources.

Thus, implementing green power solutions have immensely become an essential and efficient pathway for energy and resource conservation.</p> <br />\r\n<p>Additionally, initiating such responsibilities must include the below-mentioned pointers: <br/><br />\r\n1.<b>Reduction:</b> Reduction in terms of an environment fundamentally focusses on the appropriate use of energy and resources, carbon emissions and all associated cost. <br/><br />\r\n2.<b>Efficiency:</b> As the term itself suggests efficiency, it majorly means preventing the energy which is unnecessarily getting waste. Prevention ad saving of energy would automatically lead to cost-cutting and cost-saving. <br/> <br />\r\n3.<b>Innovation:</b> To come up with new ideologies that strive its best in proving the energy-saving solutions. <br/><br />\r\n4.<b> Engagement:</b> To participate more and more in the environment saving practices driving more of the saving of resources overconsumption. <br/><br />\r\n5.<b>Accountability:</b> A blend of appropriate usage of natural & environmental resources. </p><br />\r\n<p>Alongside this, when it comes to the reduction in the energy consumption, there are again some measures that are required to be taken into the consideration and could drive the best out of the box results such as: <br/><br />\r\n1.<b>Green energy destinations:</b> It just needs to be explored. Every destination comprises of some unique energy profile wherein, some regions still require more and more greenery and energy sourcing. <br/><br />\r\n2.<b>Green energy venues:</b> Explore the destinations that are not much blessed with the low-emissions components. Here is the best step to make a move. Try to explore the venue where more and more sources of renewable energy could be adopted both by the place and the people. <br/><br />\r\n3.<b>Responsible transportation:</b> Both practically and ideally, green-minded environmental practices could easily avoid additional use of energy majorly when it comes to transportation and commuting by designing walkable, cycle-able and transit-accessible vehicles. On the other hand, if such components don’t seem possible to have or avail at the respective moment then, try to find out the hybrid or electric vehicles inclusive of biodiesel as well. <br/><br />\r\n4.<b>Portable generation:</b> To adopt portable generation mostly prove to reduce the energy load over your power generator. Such form of initiative pertaining to generators result in the least polluting and makes the least noise. <br/><br />\r\nHenceforth, the safety of the environment is in our hands only, the more we conserve it, the more we would be able to reserve the resources for the upcoming time.

The strategy of acquiring the bulk votes was quite interesting<br />\r\nas it focussed on BPL household visits while sitting on the muddy floor and eating<br />\r\nthe meal cooked on the earthen stove or Chulhas. <br />\r\nHowever, to get the LPG cylinder under this scheme the BPL family woman required<br />\r\nto fill a form provided by the respective gas agency while paying the subsidized price<br />\r\nof ? 1750 otherwise without such scheme it would be costing ? 2950. <br />\r\nA Curse or A Cause<br />\r\nPeople of such families did enjoy the scheme until the time the cylinder doesn’t<br />\r\nrequire the refill. With the passing away of the gas, they again came back to the<br />\r\nChulhas using kerosene oil and other kinds of solid fuels. The emitted smoke from<br />\r\nsuch substances led to hazardous health issues. Moreover, as per the World Health<br />\r\nOrganisation, worldwide, 3.8 million people die because of the smoke exposure from<br />\r\nthe dirty stoves.

If,<br />\r\nUjjwala Scheme has been properly implemented focusing on the low cost of the gas<br />\r\nrefill then, it could have successfully helped the sufferers which they have been<br />\r\nfacing because of the constant use of Chulhas. <br />\r\nThe use of Chulhas adversely affects human health that it can cause a loss of vision,<br />\r\nlungs problem, inhaling or other breathing problems and a lot more than one can<br />\r\never imagine. For your safeguard, you need to take any action while not fully relying<br />\r\non government schemes. However, the government must support people with the<br />\r\nproper implementation of such schemes.

Moreover, the prices are expected to soar more by the end of February 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Triggering of Unseasonable Rainfall led Crop Damage  </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The prices of onion have risen drastically in all over the country. The reason behind the rising cost is unseasonal rain as well as the shortage of onion crop. Also, the worst part is that the rising cost has not even benefited a single farmer instead they have complained that none of the onion crops has been fetched because of its poor quality. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Increasing Consumption led to Decreasing Requirements </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In accordance with some sophisticated sources, in India, the monthly consumption of onions was 15 lakh metric tons which shows a requirement of 50 thousand metric tons. But, with the high cost, the daily supply has become 10-12%, as of now. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Appeal to Government – a Solution for a Common Man</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people and other associated welfare bodies have asked the government to create onion’s buffer stock, distribution of the staple at a reasonable cost, a crackdown on the hoarding of onion’s traders, etc just to relief a middle class and a common man. Onion as a staple of each kitchen in every household has affected not only the general public but a huge mass of farmers as well. Indian farmers have emotionally expressed a painful concern because most of them are distributing the old stock of onion because of the damaging of new onions. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just because the wholesale market has seen a huge spike in the cost, it has simultaneously affected the resulting market as well. Wherein, this sharper jump is restricting the public to make a hole in their pockets. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The nationwide surge in the spike of onion price has affected most of the Indian states and cities such as Pune, Maharashtra, Chennai, Mumbai, Odisha, West Bengal, Kolkata, Delhi and a lot more. Therein, it has affected the market chain by affecting both the sellers and consumers in buying an onion. Nevertheless, daily consumers are unfortunately are forced to reduce their purchases and are cooking their delicious food as – onion free. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Battlefield between State & Central Government </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, the worst condition expressed by the farmers is the rotten onion which can neither be used nor purchased and can only get wasted by throwing and dumping it in the dustbins. Most of the citizens have appealed to the Central Government to take impactful immediate actions but, the tussle amid the state and the central government is affecting the common man, alas!!! </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Onion’s Robbery at Dusk’s Early Hours </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, the robbery of goods that can benefit you in any ground has been seen and observed in several different cases. But, have you ever heard of Onion’s robbery. Could you ever imagine that onions can also be getting stolen? Sounds funny; but, it’s true, 250kg onions worth ?2500 have been stolen from Gujarat vegetable shop during the early hours of dawn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Government in Jitters & Public in Tears </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such a looming onion crisis has put the government in jitters as well as the general public in tears. Therein, huge strata focussing on several households, cafes, and restaurants have been affected adversely. In short, this food inflation has made the entire nation cry where people are left with no choice just to maintain a cost-cutting for onion. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Indian Government must enlighten the issue and should immediately take the concern into consideration. This is because the continuous spike in the price is neither good for the country and nor for the Indian traders and farmers who are stagnantly witnessing a great fall in the onion demand.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Onion, with which every food tastes tasteless, is now getting reduced from the daily menus, dishes, and salads. However, to avoid the further disruption of the onion trade in the country, the government has placed orders for 6,090 tonnes of onions from Egypt to prevent India from Onion’s Crisis.

Most of the people play fraudulent activities with the name of branded organization and promise to unemployed ones providing a job with complete security. When a jobseeker gets influenced by the fraudsters, they ask for money. If a person gives the quoted amount then, these fraudsters run away leaving behind a no clue of their identification. </p>\r\n<p>    \r\nNo one knows where a nation will go if this would be continuing the way it is. Also, in the era of technology as well as digitalization, Information Technology (IT) domain is phasing the rough period of streamlining cost majorly concentrating on the employees of mid to senior level.

Still, it\'s not just gotten restricted to Haryana because India needs much more improvement in the context of Girl Child. </p><br />\r\n<p>According to some renowned sources, going back to 2011 (eight years ago), in the district like Jhajjar, no one could ever imagine giving birth to a girl. Also, as per the 2011 Census, Jhajjar considered the worst district in terms of Child Sex Ratio and was also listed on the top as the worst-performing district. After Jhajjar, the district like Rewari and Kurukshetra came next in such context.</p> <br />\r\n<p>The country’s only motto is to lead its citizens with the great zeal towards each era including the girl child. Thus, it is mandatory to improve and promote gender equality wherein, since 2015, PM Narendra Modi’s launched Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Yojana from Sonipat has a bit effected the people. </p><br />\r\n<p>Since the conceptualization as well as the launch of this campaign, awareness regarding education and protecting the girl child has been increased. But, only the initiative from the government’s ends or no other government policies would work until the people would start taking initiative on their own. </p><br />\r\n<p>Since 2019, according to the sources, it has seen that a CSR of 1,647:1000 is found in Dighal village wherein, it is doing much better in raising voice against child sex abuse in compliance with its other neighbouring villages.</p> <br />\r\n<p>Also, as per the societal point of view, still today there exists a lot of people whose mindsets have changed towards gender biases and gender equality. Not everyone is feminist and not everyone abuses child sex. Today’s present generation doesn’t find and judge anything wrong or exceptional in having a baby girl. This is because, in almost all fields today, ranging from personal to professional ones, girls dominate everywhere. </p><br />\r\n<p>On the other hand, still, the majority of the older generation believe in stereotypes and strive their best in resisting the present generation to have a girl over a boy. Somewhere somehow still the fact exists in the society that having a first baby as a girl people prefer to have a boy as a second. Slowly or sooner things need to change and that definitely would bring the best outcomes in the upcoming years. </p><br />\r\n<p>However, the fundamental purpose to launch Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Yojana was to watch over the places and people who had involved themselves in the practices of using prenatal scanning or female infanticide to know the baby’s sex before his birth or within the female’s womb.</p> <br />\r\n<p>In addition to this, as per the press release of 2018’s state government, it has observed that the sex ratio is the year 2016 was 871 girls for 1,000 boys which improved to 900 girls per 1,000 boys in the year 2017. The number has been improvised because of the actions taken by the people such as FIRs against child sex abuse, awareness programs and raids at suspected ultrasound centres. </p><br />\r\n<p>Alongside the initiative taken by the local citizens, the state health department also acted as the watchdogs over the centres conducting prenatal sex determination tests. For more of the awareness, one strongly needs to educate every girl in his family with a core objective focusing on gender determination which is illegal and on sexual biases as well. Gender equality must be all above in all the eras of one\'s life. This is because a boy or a girl is one\'s personal choice to make but not a societal decision to adopt. </p><br />\r\n ', 0, 0, 0, 1500, 2, '2019-12-10 11:23:27', '2019-12-12 09:57:58'),

But, this also needs to be understood by the society that marriage is not only about physical love, sex or romance. If in any married relationship, without considering the tenure of the wedding, if your spouse especially your wife is not ready or prepared for physical love and you are forcing her to have that attention then, unfortunately, you are raping her, martially. </p><br />\r\n<strong>What Marital Rape states?</strong> <br />\r\n<p>To force a woman for physical love and attention without her permission in a marital relationship is known as Marital Rape. </p><br />\r\n<p>Talking about the Marital Rape, Narendra Modi’s government destabilizes the institution of marriage which could also act as a weapon to harass husbands. The government needs to understand and discover a stronger correlation amid saving the marriage institution as well as criminalizing marital rape. It’s a matter of concern that how difficult it could be getting a raped by a husband. From a societal point of view, this is not a big deal and is an obvious point but, for a female, this is nothing less than a brutal rape when she is not prepared and is not willing for physical love. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Just because you’re married so, forceful sex is okay</strong><br />\r\n<p>In India, there seem a lot of females who are a victim of the marital rape and continuously appeal for the justice but there is no hearing in the eyes of law, in the grounds of court and, in fact, in front of families. This is so because everyone seems that a couple is married so sex is official and is okay but, the concern gets over neglected that whether a person is willing or not without noticing that it’s a married couple. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Woman – a subject for sex, machine producing babies and idol of romance</strong><br />\r\n<p>Additionally, as per the societal point of view, in marital sex, a reasonable person is always a male wherein, a woman always ends up as a device of baby-making as well as an idol of romance. A typical marital rapist is the one who still believes that a woman can be ruled and dominated as per his will and choice. Also, he feels that in sexual matters if he wants sex then, she should be glad and if she isn’t then, a man has a complete right to force her. Overall this shows that he is an object and a lady is a sexual subject to play or mold with. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Feminism majorly exists in male dominating society</strong> <br />\r\n<p>Still today, the society is somewhere male-dominant where being feminist is not wrong. Thus, in such a male dominant society woman’s struggle is not only limited but reasonable as well. All man seriously needs to understand that a woman is not a sexual property.

In the hustle bustle of the competitive era where everyone is a player to win the organizational race, managers of the firm must focus both on the financial rewards and employees motivation as well. </p><br />\r\n<p>However, sometimes employee’s motivation using rewards becomes intimidating for the managers. This should not happen because when your work culture is armed with the correct and appropriate information and tactics then why would managers feel daunt in enhancing the motivation of his employees using rewards in no time. The managers who always develop and revamp the employee rewards program must concentrate on some of the most mandatory aspects. </p><br />\r\n<strong>This article would tell you in brief… </strong><br />\r\n<p>Employees Involvement in the implementation of a rewards program would work better because this would encourage them interacting amid all the staff no matter senior or junior. Doing so would also ensure that the upper management including all the employees is on board with the organization’s reward system.</p> <br />\r\n<p>On the contrary, it should be noticeable that employee’s involvement in such programs is a worthy effort. The managers must always value the inputs provided by them irrespective of their designation, experience and age and then, select rewards accordingly. Owing to this, the employees who see worthy efforts in rewards will always feel motivated and would often act proactively.</p> <br />\r\n<p>It’s also important on the part of managers to assure that how employees can also comprehend to earn rewards. Involving them in the programs and valuing their inputs must not be restricted. However, managers should clearly explain to them how they can earn rewards. This is because, when your employees would be having a transparent understanding of expectations then, they will be capable enough of achieving the same. <br/><br />\r\nOn the contrary, employees must also establish transparent and reasonable performance standards to achieve rewards. This would lead them to engage the necessary efforts as expected or sometimes beyond expectations. Thus, managers must check in with the employees assuring that the rewards are near to their reach. Additionally, assisting the employees with a relevant dashboard via which they could observe their daily, weekly or monthly performance in real-time as per their assigned task.

Unbiased or fair judgment always fills employees with great motivation, enthusiasm, passion, and zeal towards the work. </p><br />\r\n<p>Assuring that employees are served with the unbiased reward system abreast with the fair distribution would encourage them to obtain more rewards simultaneously would generate more productivity. Also, it must be taken into consideration that engaging in cutting corners or favoritism will render a detrimental impact on the performance of the employees. Whereas, linking rewards to the performance would influence employees leaving a positive impact. Owing to such practices, the employees would be able to see the complete transparency in the work culture, organizational environment and would also apprehend the connection amid their rewards and performance. Thus, all of them will be automatically get motivated to optimally perform in the near future. </p><br />\r\n<p>In accordance with the met expected milestones, employees must be rewarded ensuring that they have fairly received the recognition for their progress including the consistency in their behavior as per the company’s expectations. In such a case, it’s better to discover the team based incentives because this could be effective enough to make employees passionate and enthusiast towards the work simultaneously would lead in increasing both the performance and productivity. However, if an organization doesn’t work on team-based rewards then, it must include it in its rewards program where devoted resources to team-based rewards must be substantial. Such a practice would surely go to leave a significant impact on employee’s cohesiveness as well as cooperation.<br/> <br />\r\nOn the contrary, there could also be a fatal flaw of not rewarding the top performers thusly, a good performer should never be taken for granted in order to maintain and flourish the top talent not only in the team but also in the organization.

Therein, over the last couple of years, the population growth is found on the urge to exceed more and more, by and far.

Sex education is necessary especially when it comes to serious concerns like Family Planning. Thus, sex education should be available to everyone at the right age and time based on the fractioning needs, differentiating factors and some little barriers associated with the same. Hence, it becomes exceptionally essential to understand the information’s quality depending on the background, education and health infrastructure. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Hassle-Free Implementation of Ideologies for Family Planning </strong><br />\r\n<p>When it comes to the implementation and formulation of the entire guidelines in the context of the <b>family planning</b>, there must not be a lack of access towards the hassle-free implementation. Here, access means the level and depth of rigor pertaining to accessibility and affordability. Herein, both the physical accessibility as well as affordability is the two major components that must be taken into consideration while thinking of expanding your generation or family. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Healthy Acceptance of Contraceptives </strong><br />\r\n<p>While intimacy and <strong>another discussion of family planning</strong>, it is highly suggestible to properly make use of contraceptive products that too in a dignified way while respecting the modern ways of medical policies and ethics as well. </p><br />\r\n<strong>No hide and seek in communication</strong><br />\r\n<p> While having a discussion about other members of the family pertaining to the concerns and issues of family planning, proper communication with respect to everyone’s acceptance and ideologies must be respected. This is so because; a small idea or view of any family member could guide a spouse towards the right ways. Thus, clear communication is necessary without pressurizing and provoking anyone. Moreover, coming to the contraceptive commodities, it must be purchased and rendered by sophisticated sanitary personnel. </p><br />\r\n<strong> Informed & Mutual Decisions </strong><br />\r\n<p> A family doesn’t restrict to the spouse and parents instead while panning a baby, most of the relations start getting connected with each other and with a baby as well before his or her birth in the world. So, while thinking of the <b>family planning</b>, each member of the family must be informed well enough reflecting free misrepresentation of the views and personal relationship. Herein, contraceptive counseling essentially becomes comprehensive equipping members to apprehend their decisions.</p><br />\r\n<strong> Not Disclosing the Maternity Matters </strong><br />\r\n<p>Best and healthy treatment is the most crucial factor to attain during family planning and other further processes of the same. Therefore, maintaining complete confidentiality, privacy and security in the treatment and other decisions must be locked amid the doctors, health workers, co-staff and other members as well. This is so because, there are a lot of people who visit the maternity centers every day, disclosing the patient’s history would affect all in making effective decisions for planning a baby. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Women Involvement with no Forceful Decisions </strong><br />\r\n<p>While planning a family to conceive and deliver a baby, at last, it’s the woman only who has to deliver a baby. Thus, this must be ensured that the woman who becomes the recipient for family planning should be well prepared when it comes to the development spheres influencing her decision and other health measures. Additionally, when it comes to the policies concerning reproductive and sexual health, family planning must be called from an educational and healthy point of views involving gynecologists, doctors, and other co-working staff members.<br/><br />\r\nImperative accountability must be reflected in the massive family members majorly by doctors, sex educators, and lifestyle specialists, health personnel majorly including family doctors, physicians and gynecologists etc. in order to maintain a high standard of accountability.

Most often these robbers either carry a pair of extra jacket or shirt with them and always apply some lubricated substances on their body so that, if they get cached by someone they could easily slip and can run away. After acquiring the stolen goods, these robbers sell the desired products and earn their desirable profits. </p><br />\r\n<p>Their smooth escaping practice makes them difficult to trace whereas, surveillance of CCTV sometimes could help to an extent. Owing to this, police have now become familiar with their unethical practices but unfortunately, do nothing until and unless they seem their own profit in helping the victim by any means or by a bribe. </p> <br />\r\n<strong>If such remains continue to happen then, where would our nation go? </strong><br />\r\n<p>Thus, people are requested especially the females to carry the essential precautionary measures with them such as a pepper spray, a pointed pen, knife or anything that could be beneficial in self-defense.</p> <br />\r\n<strong>Eat, Repeat and Sleep – Robbery </strong><br />\r\n<p>Moreover, if an accused get caught and punished, their punishment gets restricted till imprisonment of some time. After getting released, they do the same practices again just to eat, repeat and sleep which happens in the jail as well. So, such people don’t get affected while getting caught. </p><br />\r\n<p>Thus, this won’t work in building a better as well as the developed nation instead; both the purpose and practice of crime highly need to be figured out. If this could be done, the prisoners must be rehabilitated prior to getting bailed or released. Also, they should be gone to some psychiatric therapy sessions so that no individual gets threatened again and feel unsafe on hovering on the isolated streets. <br/> <br />\r\nHence, by identifying the root cause of the problem and solving it accordingly could work better with time, somehow and someday.</p><br />\r\n ', 0, 0, 0, 5000, 2, '2020-01-27 15:06:14', '2020-02-07 18:14:46'),

This is actually so because the word epidemic itself comprises of a huge meaning in its existence. An epidemic could be anything which begins with a small symptom and later turns into a big disease and hence is termed <b>as Epidemic</b>.</p>\r\n<p>These days, the same is happening in the case of Coronavirus. However, people are getting various information and facts regarding the virus and hence, is listed as the infodemic.<br/>\r\nAs the Coronovirus is rapidly increasing in the major countries of the world wherein, China has been hugely tapped by it. The virus has been s threatening and has proven to be life taking amid the people that everyone fears with its name. The major issue is the recognition of the same i.e. how to analyse and diagnose that whether a person is suffering from some illness is either Coronavirus or something else. So, the symptoms and diagnosis of the virus are mentioned below: <br/>\r\n· Fever <br/>\r\n· Cough <br/><br />\r\n· Shortness of breath  <br/>\r\n· Runny Nose <br/>\r\n· Headache  <br/>\r\n· Sore Throat <br/>\r\nThough such symptoms are found to be very common and can be easily cured but in case of such virus, these symptoms should not be overlooked as it has caused a large number of deaths these days in just the couple of days. Thus, for confirmed, 2019-nCoV infections have reported a severe illness leading death. </p>\r\n<p>It is also believed that the symptoms of 2019-nCoV may appear either in 2 days or as long as in 14 days. Also, it is entirely based on the incubation period of the MERS virus. Apart from such noticeable symptoms, it also includes some other symptoms as well such as 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1. All such symptoms generally caused some upper-respiratory tract illnesses majorly in the context of common cold, pneumonia or bronchitis. However, such illness is basically found in the people suffering from cardiopulmonary disease and the people with the weaker immune system. </p>\r\n<p> In addition to this, one should also enlighten that the other two associated symptoms of Coronavirus i.e. MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV have also become frequently familiar with the people resulting in life-ending happenings. With the sufferings of such virus, approx. 3-4 people out of 10 have been sentenced to death on almost frequent hourly intervals. </p>\r\n<strong>What precautions one should take for avoidance and prevention of Coronavirus? </strong>\r\n•    Frequent hand washing with alcohol-based hand wash or liquid soap as it would help in killing the germs and virus. <br/>\r\n•    Maintain respiratory hygiene. This would be only performed while covering both face and mouth with tissue paper or handkerchief mainly while coughing and sneezing. Doing so would help in preventing the germs and virus and could contaminate the objects or people you come into contact with. <br/>\r\n•    Stop touching your mouth, face, nose and eyes because touching such surfaces could result in virus contamination. Touching such parts may result in virus transferring immensely and exceptionally. <br/>\r\n•    Avoid consuming animal’s products (all forms of non-veg) and stop being into contact with the animals like camel, rats, cats, rodents, birds, bats and dogs as well. <br/>\r\n<p>Therefore, the diagnosis of such symptoms has been essentially required to save people from the massively growing epidemic all around the clock. Your doctors and other health care providers should examine you by performing some of the laboratory tests on respiratory specimens all the major blood test (called serum) in order to detect the presence of Coronavirus if any. If you found the test with positive results, then, you must immediately contact your doctor informing him about your recent travelling, non-veg intake and animal’s contact. A large number of MERS-CoV infections has been detected from Arabian Peninsula’s country and so, it becomes highly essential to note and report about your travel diaries and history or animal’s contact.

However, as per the political scenarios, there have been 3 concerned contests amid Congress, Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).

Thus, on the polling date i.e. on Feb 8, voters can exercise their franchise from morning 8 am onwards. However, it is also suggested, and one should make a note of it that, you should not vote to the candidate getting influenced by your near and dear ones. This is so because, most of the times, people vote to those parties by getting influenced from their friends, family members, relatives or other acquaintances. On the other hand, the people who influence others are also requested not to brainwash or influence others in such a way that their vote seems useless or gets wasted. Doing so results in malpractices for both the people; the one who gets influenced and the one who influences others. </p><br />\r\n<p>Observing all such observations, the Election Commission of India has moved towards the EVMs (Electronic Voting Machine). EVMs have replaced the concept of Ballot Papers because people were encouraging others for forceful voting and were encouraging the candidates towards the victory. Thus, such practices are of no use, if each one would influence others for forceful voting. Basically, such kind of practice had also become a monotony as well wherein, family traditions could be listed on top. This is so because, most of the Family’s HOD say that, we have always been a supporter of this particular party from our generations so, we will be casting our vote to the same without knowing that what are their right and wrongdoings.<br />\r\nSo, open up your mind and be so rational to caste a right vote to the right candidate or a ruling party.  </p><br />\r\n ', 0, 0, 0, 6000, 1, '2020-02-10 09:50:11', '2020-02-10 09:50:11'),

The initial purpose of the protest was to assure the cops intervention against Jamia’s students who were strongly opposing the amendment of citizenship act.</p>\r\n<strong>What’s the use of doing the protest and creating violence? </strong>\r\n<p>It’s resulting in nothing except the threat to women’s safety, commodities rising cost, unemployment, poverty and a lot of more societal threats. With a major count of Muslim women, the constant protestors have also blocked various roads in Delhi NCR since December 15, 2019, using non-violent resistance for more than 55 days. Unfortunately, no one could say that how long these days are going to stretch. As of now, this protest has proven to be one of the longest on-going protests towards CAA, NRC & NPRA in India.</p>\r\n<strong>Reforming Phrase… </strong>\r\n<p>More or less, the protest is taking a new shape by and by as well as day by day. Since with its beginning with the citizenship amendment act, it has now started protesting against the BJP’s Government. Owing to this, the protestors are opposing the government\'s <strong>\"anti-labour policies\"</strong> and <strong>“2020 JNU Attack”</strong> as well.</p>\r\n<strong>Petition over Petition… Highway’s Blockade </strong>\r\n<p>The issues of highway blocking also called (blockade) had also become a campaign for 2020 Delhi’s Legislative Assembly Election with a promise made by campaigners that if the party gets voted into power the blockade would be removed for the election’s day. Moreover, the blockade affected huge traffic in a day abreast with delays of hours in the shortest journeys. </p>\r\n<p>Owing to this, around 5 petitions have been filed, as of now raising the issue of highways and roads blockade wherein, the Delhi High Court refused the hearings of initial 2 pleas and quoted towards the police matter. Simultaneously, on the other hand, the Delhi Police stated that they would use persuasion over force to take blockade at an end. When, this also failed to bring the result, again a third petition was filed on 18th January 2020 raising the student’s difficulty specifically during the exam’s time. Therein, the High Court again appeal the police to investigate the matter. Unfortunately, the situation went out of control and the matter reached to the Supreme Court with filed pleas wherein, it has been expected that after the occasion of national importance (elections), the pleas would be enlightened. </p>\r\n<strong>Why disturbance in Nation? </strong>\r\n<p>Well, alongside all such concerns, issues, violence and riots, one must also thoroughly know the root cause of all such disrupting happenings inside the nation. The CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) was passed by the Indian Parliament on 12th December 2019 that amends the Citizenship Act of 1995. Under the religious persecution’s assumptions, it granted a swifter way to Indian citizenship mainly to those people who belong to minorities like Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jains, Parsi, Christians and people mainly from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan. This act also meant for those people who entered India before 31st December 2014. Whereas, neither the act mentioned Muslims, nor did they offer the associated benefits to Muslim immigrants. Additionally, the worst part of the protest is that it has been immensely affecting the country’s economic crisis witnessing an increasing household debt as well as decreasing growth rate in income and other earning sources. </p>\r\n<strong>What’s Indifferent? </strong>\r\n<p>The protest of Shaheen Bagh began with a minimum of 10-15 women since 14th December 2019. Afterwards, this 2-digit number got extended to the strength of thousands and lakhs. Many people joined the protests including the students and children which then became 24*7 protest. Also, amid the huge crowd, most of the women were Muslim as they found of wearing a burqa. The unacceptable truth is that females with the new born babies or the lactating ones are also a part of this unworthy constant protest. </p>\r\n<strong>Hunger Strike</strong>\r\n<p>Also, to lead this protest further in most exceptional ways, many of the people amid the crowd have started volunteering it in different ways like Hunger Strike and Children Protest. Owing to this, few of the protestors were on hunger strike for days and later on got hospitalised. What was the use of doing this? Instead, one’s own health got affected and nothing happened, nothing got changed. The reason for the hunger strike was the police brutality on the students, violence on females in Jamia washroom’s and library and all the associated issues with the case. With the hunger strike, people also demanded the rollback of NRC and CAA. Unfortunately, no government office or associated governmental bodies took this hunger strike into consideration and even didn’t visit the protestors of the same. </p>\r\n<strong>Misinformation Misleading Children…Child Protest</strong>\r\n<p>Also, since day 1 of the strike, many of the children started joining their parents to participate in the strike. In the morning they attend their school afterwards they become the strike’s participant. Now, it seems like Shaheen Bagh has become an artistic space for most of the children because they express their thoughts through poetry, storytelling, mimicry, puppetry and painting graffiti. In fact, many children participate in the sit-in protest holding candles in their hands. Participating children in the protest get dressed in tricolour and express the informed thoughts by their parents.</p>\r\n<p>Observing all such unethical practices, since 21st January 2020, the NCPCR (National Commission for Protection of Child Rights) has asked the concern authorities to guide the children providing the counselling towards the protests while making them understand what’s right and what’s wrong. This is so because such drastic concerns could also drive the children towards the mental trauma likewise the way they are undergoing with the provided misinformation. </p>\r\n<strong>The nation needs the right way to run where unity needs priorities over protests. </strong>\r\n ', 0, 0, 0, 7000, 2, '2020-02-11 18:07:32', '2020-03-02 14:47:01'),

Therein, it could be also determined that many various sorts of technologies can equally inhibit or enhance various forms of the interactivity and it’s all credit goes to IT (Information Technology). This is so because, in today’s virtual world, IT is the only major component that applies to social media simultaneously affecting as well as effecting the life of people. </p><br />\r\n<p>As we are talking about the interaction that has been transformed into the virtual domain, there exist different kinds of interactivity that people often take into consideration.

Today, there have been most of the media platforms available on the Internet that are inherently active wherein, it pushes the people to react in a way like a behaviourist computer-based learning encourages people to react. It is not surprising that technologies that control a learner’s responses are often associated with more behaviourist approaches to learning.</p><br />\r\n<strong>Designed Interactivity </strong><br />\r\n<p>Several times it happens that some media gets utterly designed that automatically generates interest in the learners inclusive of engaging interactions.

Some media doesn’t always comprise of the in-built interaction wherein, its end users could still interact either with some physical responses or cognitively. For instance, the concept could be better understood considering an incident of an art gallery. Several times, people inside the art gallery respond either emotionally or cognitively to some of the particular paintings while simultaneously others may just have a glance of it or simply passes by. As per the student’s concerns, they may choose to make sketches or drawings from the painting, etc.<br/> <br />\r\nNevertheless, media that is responsible both in encouraging and provoking people have also cost some associated advantages with it.

This is so because both the instructors, as well as the learners, often have the options and preferences of choosing and using the medium pertaining that how it affects the learner’s interaction and feedback happening inside the single medium. Therefore, the design’s quality of having interactive experiences is highly important over the medium of interaction that enables activity.<br/> <br />\r\nHowever, it should also be noted that the technology’s choice can often reduce the activity’s level including the interaction’s quality. Alongside this, when it comes to the real scenarios, people are more likely to make use of an amalgamation of media assuring a quality-oriented and interactivity associated activities. Simultaneously, on the other hand, making use of varied media sources or channel are often likely to increase both the workload and the cost as well amid the learners and instructors. </p><br />\r\n ', 0, 0, 0, 10000, 2, '2020-02-14 15:00:52', '2020-03-02 12:53:18'),

Do you know India contributes an additional 1,000,000 kids to its already high population every 20 days? With a growth rate of 20% per decade Indian population has deep and long-lasting repercussions. Indian has a population of 1.3 people currently, making it the second most populated country in the world. <br />\r\n<strong>Problems Due to Rising Population: </strong><br />\r\nThe food deficit, pollution and deteriorating sanitation and infrastructure to top the list. No matter how much the economic growth rate rises, the living standards do not raise at the same rate. In India, only <strong><em>\"only 6% of India\'s poor have access to tap water versus 33% of the non-poor.\"</em>  </strong>Sanitation till date remains a huge ongoing issue that the government is unable to address. Moreover, India has some of the most polluted cities in the world. <br />\r\n<strong>Two-Child Policy in India:</strong><br />\r\nBefore January 2020 India did not have a National Child policy. Thus family Planning Policies like Two-Child Policy comes as the need of the hour by the Indian Government. National Volunteer Organization (RSS) leader Mohan Bhagwat declared in January 2020 his organization\'s primary goal as a Two-Child Policy. The proposal is being criticized as an attempt to curtail the Indian Muslim Population. <br />\r\nIndia’s National Population Policy aims to stabilize India’s population by 2045. <br />\r\n<strong><em>\"A two-child policy is a government-imposed limit of two children allowe</em></strong><strong><em>d per </em></strong><strong><em>family, with the perks of government subsidies given only to the first two children.\"</em></strong><br />\r\nUnder the two-child policy - persons with more than two children would not be eligible to serve in government jobs. The act also called the Population Control Act, 2016 is applicable to all of India. As per the act, no person should procreate more than two living children after a period of one year from the commencement of the Act. <br />\r\nMany Indian states have adopted the two-child policy. It was Assam where the policy was most recently implemented in 2017. By 2017, 12 states had called for the two-child limitation for being eligible for a government job. The states are Odisha, Bihar, Chattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana. The policy has repealed by some of the states like Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Chattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. <br />\r\nAs per a report of the East Asia Forum India\'s population is projected to be 1.69 billion by 2050. It will make India\'s population higher than that of China.  Looking at the population prediction of India by 2050 the country may undergo a crisis situation. The demand for food and water will double up by 2050. India may be able to feed the growing population, however, may not be ecologically sustainable. Thus, the two-child policy is the most promising solution to the family planning initiative by the Indian Government. <br />\r\n#TwoChildPolicy #FamilyPlanningIndia #PopulationPolicy</span></span><br />\r\n <br />\r\n ', 0, 0, 0, 8000, 3, '2020-03-20 22:10:05', '2020-03-27 15:39:33'),

Quantum computers might one day revolutionise tasks that would take existing computers years, including the hunt for new drugs and optimising city and transportation planning.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe technique relies on quantum bits, or qubits, which can register data values of zero and one — the language of modern computing — simultaneously. Big tech companies including Google, Microsoft, IBM and Intel are avidly pursuing the technology.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\"Quantum things can be in multiple places at the same time,\" said Chris Monroe, a University of Maryland physicist who is also the founder of quantum startup IonQ. \"The rules are very simple, they\'re just confounding.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat\'s a quantum computer?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDescribing the inner workings of a quantum computer isn’t easy, even for top scholars. That’s because the machines process information at the scale of elementary particles such as electrons and photons, where different laws of physics apply.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“It’s never going to be intuitive,” said Seth Lloyd, a mechanical engineering professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “At this microscopic level, things are weird. An electron can be here and there at the same time, at two places at once.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConventional computers process information as a stream of bits, each of which can be either a zero or a one in the binary language of computing. But quantum bits, known as qubits, can register zero and one simultaneously.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat can it do?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn theory, the special properties of qubits would allow a quantum computer to perform calculations at far higher speeds than current supercomputers. That makes them good tools for understanding what’s happening in the realms of chemistry, material science or particle physics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat speed could aid in discovering new drugs, optimizing financial portfolios and finding better transportation routes or supply chains.
